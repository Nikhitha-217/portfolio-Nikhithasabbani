        <h2 class="hd">MY EXPERIENCES</h2>
        <p class="ld">Till my diploma,we don't have any type of extra curricular activities in our college or school. But after getting admission into the btech i got awareness about student clubs in our college. As i have interest in leading i just participated in the clubs and was stood in the leading. </p>
        <h3 class="club">My Leading Experience</h3>
        <p class="ld"> First after a month of getting admission we had a call that "In our college we are having elections for leading positions in the IOT club. Selections will be interview process" when i heard this announcement i was thrilled and also little bit scared that it was interview process.But when i was attending the interview, I spoked out loud and was saying my eligibility for the role and I was selected and for next 6 months i was the lead for IOT club. We collaboratively done many workshops on IOT</p>
        <h4 class="club">My leading Experience in SWECHA-GLUG</h4>
        <p class="ld">In SWECHA-GLUG my journey started from REDDI-HACKATHON. In the Hackathon i was participating and i was very happy that no girl in our college standing on stage was not talking holding the mic but i presented my presentation alone. After hackathon, i was attending the internship who were only one student from our college from 2<sup>nd</sup> year and almost all were seniors. After te 15 days journey of internship I were identified by the Swecha-glug EC members and they were encouraging me to participate in lead and for taking intiative and our first event was of datathon which was the part of building telugu chatgpt. Swecha-Glug was very special experience for me because every EC member of it was guiding us very good and after many events of organisation we left swecha-glug for 3 months.To focus on our career. Not only that we honoured many certificates from Swecha-Glug.</p>
        <h4 class="club">Project Experience</h4>
        <p class="ld">As i was teaching assistant and volunteer in web development workshop in our college. I don't have deep knowledge of everything as my diploma/polytechnic was in civil branch and i am new to the computer science branch. But i have improved myself and learnt everything from scratch and developed my projects one is chatbot and another one is beauty salon project.<br> These are my experiences of my Leading and also projects.</p>
