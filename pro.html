                <p class="card-text">This is my first project which was done in the month of march. My reference was youtube and i was searching for many projects but i found my first project were easy and good and i tried this. As i dont have any guidance i myself guided everything by watching videos on youtube.
                this was my inspiring story also because i don't know how to do a project and i was just testing myself in different online platforms.At that time i got to know about this type of projects by youtube and the youtuber was doddagatta nihar.I wish to thank him also.</p>

This was not only inspiration from first project but this is another inspiration for me from my mother. My mother is a beautician and she recently started a new branch and she was asking me, Is there any easy method or way to know whole world my techniques and my services? then at that time i decided to take this project as initiative and work on this project. So this project will be very special for me.</p>
